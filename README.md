# demo1
my first learning repository of Github.
<br>
next line using html like syntax.<br>

we cloned the repository using command "" git clone _link_ ""
using command ""cd _filename_ "" we moved our directory scope to the inside folder of the given folder like we moved form our git learning folder to demo1
""ls"" to view files of our directory
""ls -a"" to view all files including those hidden files of the directory.
so after this it showed us the hidden folder .git in it.
using ""git commit _file name_"" commited the change.
then after that using ""git push"" published the change on github.

note :-- in terminal when we try to use our git command it not works that well beacuse we have to again go to that repository i.e. have to ste our target agai  at that point using the code ""cd _file_name_""" again again till we get to that folder we can check it using if we reached or not by using the code ""git status"".
