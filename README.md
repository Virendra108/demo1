# demo1
my first learning repository of Github.
<br>
next line using html like syntax.

we cloned the repository using command "" git clone <link> ""
using command ""cd <filename> "" we moved our directory scope to the inside folder of the given folder like we moved form our git learning folder to demo1
""ls"" to view files of our directory
""ls -a"" to view all files including those hidden files of the directory.
so after this it showed us the hidden folder .git in it.
using ""git commit <file name>"" commited the change.
then after that using ""git push"" published the change on github.
